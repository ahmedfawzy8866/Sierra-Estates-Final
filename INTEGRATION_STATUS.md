# Sierra Blu Platform — Staged Integration Status

**Date**: 2026-05-29  
**Target Repo**: `ahmedfawzy8866/i-sierra-2027`  
**Base Branch**: `main`  
**Integration Approach**: staged and selective (no blind bulk merge)

---

## What was integrated in this repository

The current monorepo already contains the unified Sierra app shape:

- `apps/web` (Next.js web app)
- `apps/admin` (admin interface)
- `functions/` (Firebase Cloud Functions)
- `packages/` (shared packages for API, auth, db, config, agents, UI)
- `workflows/` (operational scripts)

This structure is kept as the central source of truth for future Sierra work.

## What was intentionally **not** merged wholesale

To keep the target repo clean and maintainable:

- External/fork-style repos were treated as selective references, not full imports.
- Non-Sierra-core repositories (skills/plugins/tooling/forks) were not blindly merged.
- Branch-only experiments that could not be safely landed immediately were preserved by explicit branch references above, avoiding duplicate code drops.

---

## Branch-conflict handling

Given the user guidance that some branch conflicts may contain valuable work:

- Valuable branch tips were reviewed across the core Sierra repos.
- The integration kept the monorepo coherent and deduplicated rather than importing competing copies of similar app code.
- Branch-specific alternatives remain recoverable from their original branches and can be cherry-picked in focused follow-up PRs.

---

## Validation and quality checks performed

Local validation in this repo:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm type-check`
- `pnpm test:ci`
- `pnpm build`

Result: commands completed successfully in this environment (lint reports existing warnings only, no lint errors).

CI audit (GitHub Actions) also reviewed for recent failures:

- `Deploy to Vercel` failure due to unresolved `vercel/action` reference.
- `External Workflows — Sync Data with Sheets` failure due to missing dependency cache path (`workflows/package-lock.json`).

These are tracked as follow-up workflow hardening items and were not merged blindly into app code during this integration pass.

---

## Recommended follow-up work

1. Resolve workflow-only CI issues (`deploy.yml` Vercel action resolution and external workflow cache path).
2. Create focused PRs for any branch-specific features that need cherry-picking from:
   - `ahmedfawzy8866/68e6464b99f91883e5fc1c2c2d41e34852b59d5460a7233cb507631612785c27:sierra-blu-consolidation`
   - `ahmedfawzy8866/New-folder:fix/hero-bilingual-testability-13034483362030825337`
   - `ahmedfawzy8866/Sierra-Blu-Systm:copilot/integrate-frontend-and-update-hero-page`
3. Re-run branch-diff review after gaining access to currently private/unavailable repositories.
